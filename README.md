# Elevators Project

## Overview

Nodejs is used to manage both backend and frontend project.  This simplifies installation instructions.  Use of nodejs on backend is not an endorsement of the technology, because there are equally good if not better solutions based on .NET or GO language.

A single GIT repository is used to manage both projects to simplify snapshotting of functional application state.  Usually a meta project would be setup that ties separate GIT repositories using GIT submodules feature.  GIT submodules feature complicates source code management and is a deterrant during early development stages when both backend and frontend change significantly.
